...NOTOC__thumb , one of the many SSSIs in Wiltshire designated for their grassland plant communities. The following is a list of Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Wiltshire, England, United Kingdom.  In England the body responsible for designating SSSIs is Natural England, which chooses a site because of its fauna, flora  , geological or physiographical features.  As of 2006, there are 134 sites designated in this Area of Search, of which the vast majority, 108, have been designated due to their biological interest, with just 21 due to their geological interest (and 5 for both).   Natural England took over the role of designating and managing SSSIs from English Nature in October 2006 when it was formed from the amalgamation of English Nature, parts of the Countryside Agency and the Rural Development Service.  Natural England, like its predecessor, uses the 1974-1996 county system and as such the same approach is followed here, rather than adopting the current local government  or ceremonial county  boundaries.  The data in the table is taken from English Natures website in the form of citation sheets for each SSSI.  For other counties, see List of SSSIs by Area of Search.

...In the film and media industry, if a film released in theatres {{ Movie theater }} fails to break even {{ Break-even (economics) }} by a large amount, it is considered a box office bomb or box office flop, thus losing money for the distributor {{ Film distributor }} , studio {{ Film studio }} , and/or production company that invested in it.  Unless officially acknowledged by studios, figures of losses are usually rough estimates at best.  This is mostly due to Hollywood accounting practices that typically manipulate profits or keep costs secret to avoid profit-sharing agreements.  In some cases, a company can make profits from a box office bomb when ancillary revenues are taken into account, such as home media {{ Home video }} sales and rentals, television broadcast rights, and licensing rights, so a film that performs poorly at the box office can still break even after its theatrical run.
